To build this app, you'll need kdelibs headers from KDE 4 available.

Furthermore there is (for now) a dependency on KGraphViewer and
hence the Graphviz bundle. The former you must compile from
sources since I had to make quite a few changes to make it applicable
for this usecase. See also: http://extragear.kde.org/apps/kgraphviewer/

I plan to make the graphviewer dependency optional in future.

When you got all this, you simply do the usual CMake run:

cd massif-visualizer
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

That should be it.
